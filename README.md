# Example Projects built with [WCF Web API](http://wcf.codeplex.com) #

This goal of this project is to port the [ServiceStack.Examples](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Examples) (made by the one and only [Demis Bellot](https://twitter.com/#!/demisbellot)) to the latest builds of the [WCF Web API](http://wcf.codeplex.com).

The plan is to leave the clients unchanged and only port the server side implementations.

## Finished implementations / forks ##
